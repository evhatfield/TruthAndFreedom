			<p style="text-indent:.5in">Choosing a title for a Bible Correspondence Course is
			difficult. I chose this title, PATH TO TRUTH AND FREEDOM
			– GUIDE TO SEEKERS OF TRUTH, since truth and freedom
			are universal concepts valued by people of goodwill everywhere.
			Truth inevitably leads to freedom; error inescapably
			ends in bondage. Jesus Christ said, “Ye shall know the truth,
			and the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32). He also said,
			“Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin” (John 8:34).
			Truth is under attack. Today, men fabricate “truth” to please
			their own desires, and at the same time deny the existence of
			absolute truth. Isaiah the prophet 700 years before Christ said
			this would happen. “And judgment is turned away backward,
			and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street,
			and equity cannot enter” (Isaiah 59:14). Despite these attacks,
			truth is alive and well. Truth does not need defending; it only
			needs declaring. If you have a hunger for truth and a desire
			for freedom to live a life pleasing to the One, True, and Living
			God, then you will find help and hope here.</p>

			<p style="text-indent:.5in">Each of us must make choices about the path we will
			take in our lives. God has given each of us the ability and the
			responsibility to know and respond to the path of truth. “That
			was the true Light (Jesus Christ), which lighteth every man that
			cometh into the world” (John 1:9). Instead, most people choose
			the broad path that leads to destruction. Those who choose
			to follow the other, narrow path, the path to life eternal, must
			then choose other paths along that narrow way. Hopefully, they
			will choose to walk the path of consecration, i.e., determining
			to do those things that please God. Unfortunately, however,
			many who choose to trust Christ as their Savior do not choose
			to make Him Lord of their lives. They make choices that are
			contrary to God’s revealed will. Those who fail to walk close
			to God and choose to go their own way and do their own thing
			miss out on the blessings of the Christian life. They fail to enjoy the
			comfort and blessings that God bestows on His obedient children.
			They fall into a double-trap: they offend the God who saved them,
			and they cheat themselves out of His highest blessing. </p>
	
			<p style="text-indent:.tin">In this Bible course, our aim is to show you the path of truth
			and freedom--that the Holy Bible is God’s Word, and, therefore it
			speaks authoritatively. “Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning
			all things to be right; and I hate every false way” (Psalm
			119:128). The God of the Holy Bible is the creator God and He lets
			it be known that He alone is God. “I am the LORD, and there is
			none else, there is no God beside me” (Isaiah 45:5). Self-centered
			fools masquerading as learned scholars sow confusion and doubt in
			the minds of the younger generation. Our purpose is to present truth
			and to give evidence that faith in God is not unreasonable. Since the
			Big Lie of (evolution) seeks to intimidate seekers of truth, we will
			also deal with the question of origins.</p>

			<p style="text-indent:.5in">In the first few chapters, we attempt to lay a foundation for
			that which follows. Because people of every creed, color, and
			culture need deliverance from sin, we answer four important
			questions: Why is salvation (deliverance) needed? How is salvation
			provided? How is salvation received? Can a person know for
			sure that he or she will go to heaven at death? Once a person is
			confronted with the Gospel, is convicted by the Holy Spirit and is
			convinced that trusting in the finished work of Christ is the only
			solution for salvation and chooses to receive Christ as his personal
			Savior, he experiences the miracle of being born again. In addition,
			he instantly becomes a member of the “body of Christ.” </p>
			
			<p style="text-indent:.5in">The next step is confessing Christ openly as newfound Lord.
			There are two ways to confess Christ: first, through word of mouth
			or a verbal statement and second, through the ordinance of baptism.
			Very carefully we explain the significance of baptism. Baptism is
			an ordinance of the church. Those who choose to follow the Lord
			in baptism also choose to associate with and become a part of the
			church of Jesus Christ. We can say that baptism is the first step
			of obedience and growth in the Christian life. The second step of
			obedience and growth as a newly baptized believer is to join in
			fellowship and service in a local church. One of the many blessings
			of church membership is to partake of the Lord’s Supper or communion.
			We will help you understand what this beautiful ordinance
			of the church is all about.</p>

			<p style="text-indent:.5in">What is the church? What is its purpose? Where did it come
			from and where is it going? We will answer all these questions and
			many others. Why is the church so essential to those who choose to
			walk in Christ’s path? Can just anyone join the church? We explain
			who are entitled to be church members. We will review the duties
			of church members so all can understand. Who has God called to
			lead the church? Who gives them the authority to lead? We will
			discuss the qualifications of pastors and deacons (church leaders)
			and their responsibilities. The author of this course is a follower of
			Christ by choice and a Baptist by conviction. We point out Biblebased
			Baptist distinctives and carefully teach how Baptists differ
			from other denominations. The Holy Bible is God’s book and those
			who are true Baptists seek to follow closely the commandments
			God has given to the church. We never knowingly or willfully go
			against any teaching of the Bible.</p>

			<p style="text-indent:.5in">You will find at the end of each chapter a list of questions. The
			answers to these questions will be in the text of the chapter. Carefully
			fill out the questions and send them to the designated address.
			Your paper will be graded and returned. On successfully completing
			the course, you will receive a beautiful certificate. At the same
			time, you will grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus
			Christ.</p>
