			<p>Dear Student:</p>

			<p style="text-indent:.5in">I am pleased to know of your interest in studying our
				Vision 2020 Asia Truth and Freedom Bible course by postal correspondence.  I
				strongly believe that this is not accidental but the Almighty’s omnipotent plan
				for you to join our course and experience the truth that can make you free.  I
				am very sure that as you go through each lesson you will understand truth in
				depth.  It is truth that will make way to freedom in your life. Truth is
				timeless.  Truth does not differ from one age to another, from one people to
				another or from one geographical location to another.  Men’s ideas may differ,
				men’s customs may change, men’s moral codes may vary but the great
				all-prevailing Truth stands for time and eternity.  The Bible says that knowing
				Christ brings both truth and freedom. </p>
	
			<p style="text-indent:.5in">The lessons are
				written in an easy to read style and deal with vital issues such as: Is the
				Bible truly the Word of God? Evolution - the Big Lie; Is there really a God?
				What is God like? The uniqueness of Jesus Christ; Is there life after death?
				Why is salvation needed? How is salvation provided? and How is salvation
				received?  The subjects of baptism, the Lord's Supper; and the Church are
				discussed in detail.  The final three chapters teach what God is doing in the
				world and why people refuse God's great gift of salvation.  At the end of each
				chapter there are five points to ponder and ten questions to answer. This Bible
				course will be helpful to you to secure your future life through Jesus Christ
				who is the only Savior of the world.</p>
